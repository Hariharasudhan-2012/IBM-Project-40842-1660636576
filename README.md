# :warning: Problem Statement 

The world faces major environmental challenges associated with waste generation and inadequate waste collection, transport, treatment, and disposal. It is a matter of health safety. Tuberculosis, pneumonia, diarrhea, tetanus, whooping cough, etc. are other common diseases spread due to improper waste management. The toxic wastes can lead to different kinds of pollution - air, water, and soil. Our current systems cannot cope with the volumes of waste generated by an increasingly urban population and this has a huge impact on the environment and public health.

# :triangular_flag_on_post: Objectives

This project aims to design and implement a combination of IoT and Application Development based Waste Management Systems. The combination of IoT and Application Development has plenty of applications such as home security systems, payment technologies, intruder recognition systems, etc. This research utilizes the application for Waste Management. The kit consists of hardware and software parts. The hardware part comprises a sensor unit, which detects the volume of waste present in the bin, a weight-detecting garbage system, a GPS locator, and a GSM module to communicate with a mobile device. The software part uses Python codes and C codes.

### Objectives (Major):

:checkered_flag: Reduce Air, Water, and Soil Pollution <br>
:checkered_flag: Reduce Manual Labour <br>
:checkered_flag: Increase Sustainable Development <br>
:checkered_flag: Reduce common health issues related to improper waste management techniques

# :books: Literature Survey
Waste management plays a crucial role these days. As environmental concerns grow, wastes are to be properly managed and recycled. Improper management will lead to air pollution, and soil erosion may even affect human health. Lisa Saffro, et al. enhance the point about the health impacts of incineration, landfill, composting, landspreading sewage sludge, and sewage discharges [1]. A step to reduce the risks is the proposed work of waste management using IoT. Gopal Kirshna Shyam, et al. submitted a work that utilizes sensors and uses an IoT algorithm that can read, collect, and transmit a huge volume of data over the Internet. These data, when put into a Spatio-temporal context and processed by intelligent and optimized algorithms, can be dynamically handled by waste collection processes [2]. The published work by Tran Anh Khoa et al put forth a low-cost IoT architecture that efficiently achieves waste management by predicting the probability of the waste level in trash bins, by using machine learning and graph theory,  and determine the shortest path of waste collection. It also examines the data transfer on the LoRa module and demonstrates the advantages of the system, which is implemented through a simple circuit designed with low cost, ease of use, and replaceability [3]. "Challenges and Opportunities of Waste Management in IoT-Enabled Smart Cities: A Survey" by Theodoros Anagnostopoulos, et al. gives detailed information on various aspects of IoT in waste management [4]. With the above references, this project proposes a Smart Waste Management System For Metropolitan Cities that detects the level of Garbage in bins, and the weight of the garbage in the bin and alerts the authorized person to empty the bin whenever the bins are full. With further advancements, the Garbage level of the bins can be monitored through a Web App through which we can view the location of every bin by sending GPS location from the device.
